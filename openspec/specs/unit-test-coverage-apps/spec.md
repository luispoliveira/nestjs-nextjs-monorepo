## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: auth app reaches 80% unit test coverage

The `apps/auth` app SHALL have unit tests covering `LocalAuthService` and `AuthTrpcMiddleware` such that `pnpm test:cov` exits 0 with ≥80% statements, branches, functions, and lines.

#### Scenario: ensureAdminUser skips creation when admin already exists

- **THEN** `authService.api.signUpEmail` is called with the configured admin email and password
- **THEN** `DatabaseService.user.update` is called to set `emailVerified: true` and `role: 'admin'`

#### Scenario: handlePasswordChanged emits notification for authenticated user
- **WHEN** `LocalAuthService.handlePasswordChanged()` is called with a valid session context
- **THEN** `notificationsPublisher.emitUserPasswordChanged` is called with the user id, email, and reason

#### Scenario: handlePasswordChanged throws when session is not found
- **WHEN** `LocalAuthService.handlePasswordChanged()` is called and `authService.api.getSession` returns null
- **THEN** an Error is thrown with message "Session not found"

#### Scenario: handleTwoFactorEnabled emits notification
- **WHEN** `LocalAuthService.handleTwoFactorEnabled()` is called with a valid session context
- **THEN** `notificationsPublisher.emitUserTwoFactorEnabled` is called with user id and email

#### Scenario: handleTwoFactorDisabled emits notification
- **WHEN** `LocalAuthService.handleTwoFactorDisabled()` is called with a valid session context
- **THEN** `notificationsPublisher.emitUserTwoFactorDisabled` is called with user id and email

#### Scenario: AuthTrpcMiddleware passes user into context when session is valid
- **WHEN** `AuthTrpcMiddleware.use()` is called and `authService.api.getSession` returns a session with user and session objects
- **THEN** `next()` is called with the original context merged with the user

#### Scenario: AuthTrpcMiddleware throws Unauthorized when session is null
- **WHEN** `AuthTrpcMiddleware.use()` is called and `authService.api.getSession` returns null
- **THEN** an Error is thrown with message "Unauthorized"

#### Scenario: AuthTrpcMiddleware throws Unauthorized when getSession throws
- **WHEN** `AuthTrpcMiddleware.use()` is called and `authService.api.getSession` throws
- **THEN** an Error is thrown with message "Unauthorized"

### Requirement: notifications app reaches 80% unit test coverage

The `apps/notifications` app SHALL have unit tests covering `AppController` and all `AppService` methods such that `pnpm test:cov` exits 0 with ≥80% statements, branches, functions, and lines.

#### Scenario: AppController.sendUserCreatedNotification validates and delegates
- **WHEN** `sendUserCreatedNotification` is called with a valid payload
- **THEN** `appService.sendUserCreatedNotification` is called with the validated email

#### Scenario: AppController.sendPasswordResetNotification delegates with email and token
- **WHEN** `sendPasswordResetNotification` is called with a valid payload
- **THEN** `appService.sendPasswordResetNotification` is called with email and resetToken

#### Scenario: AppController.sendPasswordChangeConfirmation delegates
- **WHEN** `sendPasswordChangeConfirmation` is called with a valid payload
- **THEN** `appService.sendPasswordChangeConfirmation` is called with the email

#### Scenario: AppController.sendEmailVerificationNotification delegates with link
- **WHEN** `sendEmailVerificationNotification` is called with a valid payload
- **THEN** `appService.sendEmailVerificationNotification` is called with email and verificationLink

#### Scenario: AppController.sendTwoFactorEnabledNotification delegates
- **WHEN** `sendTwoFactorEnabledNotification` is called with a valid payload
- **THEN** `appService.sendTwoFactorEnabledNotification` is called with the email

#### Scenario: AppController.sendTwoFactorDisabledNotification delegates
- **WHEN** `sendTwoFactorDisabledNotification` is called with a valid payload
- **THEN** `appService.sendTwoFactorDisabledNotification` is called with the email

#### Scenario: AppService.sendPasswordChangeConfirmation delegates to producer
- **WHEN** `AppService.sendPasswordChangeConfirmation` is called with an email
- **THEN** `EmailProducer.sendPasswordChangedEmail` is called with that email

#### Scenario: AppService.sendTwoFactorEnabledNotification delegates to producer
- **WHEN** `AppService.sendTwoFactorEnabledNotification` is called with an email
- **THEN** `EmailProducer.sendTwoFactorEnabledEmail` is called with that email

#### Scenario: AppService.sendTwoFactorDisabledNotification delegates to producer
- **WHEN** `AppService.sendTwoFactorDisabledNotification` is called with an email
- **THEN** `EmailProducer.sendTwoFactorDisabledEmail` is called with that email

### Requirement: worker app reaches 80% unit test coverage

The `apps/worker` app SHALL have unit tests covering `DlqController`, `EmailDlqService`, `QueueMetricsService`, and the uncovered branches in `EmailConsumer` such that `pnpm test:cov` exits 0 with ≥80% statements, branches, functions, and lines.

#### Scenario: DlqController.list delegates to emailDlqService.list
- **WHEN** `DlqController.list()` is called with page and limit
- **THEN** `emailDlqService.list` is called with those values and the result is returned

#### Scenario: DlqController.replay delegates to emailDlqService.replay
