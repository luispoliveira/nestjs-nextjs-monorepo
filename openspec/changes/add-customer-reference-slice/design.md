# Design

## Context

See proposal.md (Why) and the two delta specs (`customer-management`, `pii-field-encryption`) for the required behaviour. Current state that shapes the approach:

- `apps/api` already registers `MicroserviceAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard` as `APP_GUARD`. Authentication (bearer or `better-auth.session_token` cookie, see `ContextUtil.extractToken`) and `@Roles()` checks need no new wiring. URI versioning defaults to `1`, so routes land on `/api/v1/...`.
- `EncryptionService` (`packages/shared/src/encryption`) already exposes `encrypt` (AES-256-GCM, random IV), `decrypt` and `blindIndex` (HMAC-SHA256), and loads `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_HMAC_KEY` from `ConfigService`. No app provides it yet.
- `LoggingInterceptor` persists sanitized request **and** response bodies to Mongo through `SanitizeUtil`, whose `SENSITIVE_KEYS` list has no NIF key. pino redacts only fixed `req.body.*` password paths.
- `paginationSchema` has a free-form `sortBy: z.string()`. `paginatedSchema()` and `PaginatedUtil.getPaginatedResponse()` already produce the shared `{ items, meta }` shape.
- Prisma columns are camelCase (no field-level `@map`). The generator is `prisma-client` on ^7.10, which is past the 7.4 release that introduced the `partialIndexes` preview.
- `apps/web` has no `HttpClient` provider. Every data call today goes through `AUTH_CLIENT`. `proxy.conf.json` forwards `/api` to `apps/api` in dev, and nginx does the same in prod, so `/api` is same-origin and the session cookie is sent automatically.
- `DatabaseSeederService` runs on every `apps/api` boot, and `packages/database` cannot import `@repo/shared` (`shared` depends on `database`).

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- A slice whose file layout is the pattern to copy: one Nest feature module, one shared-types schema file, one Angular feature folder.
- DB-enforced invariants where the DB can enforce them (NIF uniqueness), app code elsewhere.
- Removable by deleting the `customers/` folders, the schema file exports, the model and its migration.

**Non-Goals:**
- A generic "encrypted field" abstraction (Prisma extension, decorator). There is one field, so explicit calls in the service are enough. The follow-up generator change can extract an abstraction if a second field appears.
- Full-text or trigram search. `ILIKE '%term%'` has no index support, which is acceptable for backoffice-sized tables (see Risks).
- Demo seed data (see proposal Non-goals).

## Decisions

### D1 — Data model (`packages/database`)

```prisma
generator client {
  // ...existing fields
  previewFeatures = ["partialIndexes"]
}

model Customer {
  id        String    @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
  deletedAt DateTime?

  name           String
  email          String?
  notes          String?
  taxIdEncrypted String?  // base64(iv || tag || ciphertext)
  taxIdHash      String?  // HMAC-SHA256 hex of the normalized NIF

  @@unique([taxIdHash], where: { deletedAt: null })
  @@index([deletedAt, createdAt])
  @@map("customer")
}
```

- The partial unique index implements "unique among active customers" (spec), and its NULL semantics make an absent NIF never collide.
- `@@index([deletedAt, createdAt])` serves the default listing (`deletedAt IS NULL ORDER BY createdAt DESC`).
- Migration: `pnpm db:migrate --name add_customer`, a new migration and never an edit of `init`.
- *Alternative:* raw `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... WHERE "deletedAt" IS NULL` hand-written in the migration SQL. Rejected as the default because the schema would not know about the index, and the next `prisma migrate dev` would detect drift and try to drop it. It stays the documented fallback if the preview is removed.
- *Alternative:* app-level `findFirst` before insert. Racy, rejected (spec requires correctness under concurrency).

### D2 — Shared schemas (`packages/shared-types/src/schemas/customer.schema.ts`)

- `normalizeNif(input: string): string` strips whitespace and an optional case-insensitive `PT` prefix. `isValidNif(canonical)` checks for exactly 9 digits plus the mod-11 check digit (weights 9..2; `check = 11 - sum % 11`, and `10`/`11` map to `0`).
- `nifSchema = z.string().transform(normalizeNif).refine(isValidNif, 'Invalid NIF')`. The browser form and the API DTO both go through it, which satisfies the "identical normalization" spec requirement by construction.
- `customerSchema` (response): `id`, `name`, `email: nullable`, `taxId: nullable`, `notes: nullable`, `createdAt`/`updatedAt` as the existing date schema. Uses `.meta({ id: 'Customer' })`.
- `createCustomerSchema`: `name` trimmed 1–200, `email: z.email().optional()`, `taxId: nifSchema.optional()`, `notes: max(2000).optional()`. Uses `.meta({ id: 'CreateCustomer' })`.
- `updateCustomerSchema`: every field optional, and `email`/`taxId`/`notes` also accept `null` (clear). Uses `.meta({ id: 'UpdateCustomer' })`.
- `customerListQuerySchema = paginationSchema.extend({ sortBy: z.enum(['name','email','createdAt','updatedAt']).default('createdAt'), sortOrder: …default('desc'), search: z.string().trim().optional() })`, **without** a root `.meta({ id })`. Same reason as the comment on `paginationSchema`: a root id on a query DTO breaks Swagger generation.
- `customersListResponseSchema = paginatedSchema(customerSchema)`.
- The generic `paginationSchema` stays untouched. Narrowing happens per resource.

### D3 — API module (`apps/api/src/customers/`)

```
customers/
  customers.module.ts      providers: CustomersService, EncryptionService
  customers.controller.ts  @Controller('customers')
  customers.service.ts
  customers.dto.ts         createZodDto(...) wrappers of the shared schemas
```

| Method | Path | Roles | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/customers` | any authenticated | 200 `{items, meta}` | 401, 400 |
| GET | `/api/v1/customers/:id` | any authenticated | 200 | 401, 404 |
| POST | `/api/v1/customers` | `ADMIN` | 201 | 401, 403, 400, 409 |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/customers/:id` | `ADMIN` | 200 | 401, 403, 400, 404, 409 |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/customers/:id` | `ADMIN` | 204 (`@HttpCode(204)`) | 401, 403, 404 |

- Authorization: `@Roles(RoleEnum.ADMIN)` on the three write handlers only. Reads rely on the global `MicroserviceAuthGuard`. No new guards, and `role-based-authorization` semantics are unchanged.
- Responses go through `@ZodSerializerDto(CustomerDto)` (global `ZodSerializerInterceptor`), so `taxIdEncrypted`/`taxIdHash` can never leak even if the mapper regresses.
- `CustomersModule` is imported in `AppModule`. The `AppController` hello route stays.

### D4 — Service behaviour (`apps/api`)

- **Encrypt on write:** if `taxId` is a string, set `taxIdEncrypted = encrypt(nif)` and `taxIdHash = blindIndex(nif)`. If it is `null`, set both to `null`. If it is `undefined`, leave them untouched. The value is already normalized by the DTO.
- **Decrypt on read:** a single `toResponse(row)` maps `taxIdEncrypted → taxId` (decrypt or `null`).
- **Soft delete:** every query includes `deletedAt: null`. Update/delete use `updateMany({ where: { id, deletedAt: null } })`, and `count === 0` raises `NotFoundException`, which avoids a separate find. Update then re-reads the row to return it.
- **Uniqueness:** no pre-check. A Prisma `P2002` on create/update is mapped to `ConflictException` (409). That is race-safe because the index decides.
- **List:** `where = { deletedAt: null, OR? }`. With a non-empty `search`, `OR` contains `name`/`email` `contains` + `mode: 'insensitive'`, plus `{ taxIdHash: blindIndex(normalizeNif(search)) }` only when `isValidNif(normalizeNif(search))`. `findMany` + `count` run in one `$transaction`, then `PaginatedUtil.getPaginatedResponse`.
- *Alternative:* a Prisma client extension that encrypts transparently. Rejected for one field (Non-Goals). Explicit code is what a reader copying the slice needs to see.

### D5 — Log redaction (`packages/shared`)

- Add `'taxid'` to `SENSITIVE_KEYS` in `SanitizeUtil`. It already lowercases keys and recurses, so it covers request bodies and `items[].taxId` in list responses written by `LoggingInterceptor`.
- Add `'req.body.taxId'` to pino's `redact.paths`.
- Logged URLs: `SanitizeUtil.sanitizeUrl()` redacts the value of every query parameter listed in `SENSITIVE_QUERY_PARAMS` (`search`). It is applied to the `LoggingInterceptor` `url` field, pino's `req` serializer and `AllExceptionFilter`'s log lines. A NIF search sends the plaintext in the query string, and search terms in general may be names or emails. Found during the manual smoke test. The `path` in error *responses* is not a log and is left as is. Access logs of nginx or another proxy are outside the app and out of scope.
- This is a key-name rule. Any future field named `taxId` in any app is redacted too, which is the intended default for a template. Other PII fields added later must be appended to the same list. This is called out in the removal/usage note.

### D6 — Configuration (`apps/api`, `scripts/setup.mjs`)

- `apiEnvSchema` adds `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY: z.string().min(1)` and `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_HMAC_KEY: z.string().min(1)`. A missing value fails Zod env validation at boot and names the variable. The 32-byte length check stays in `EncryptionService.loadKey`, which already throws with the required length, and it runs at module init, so it is still a boot failure.
- `apps/api/.env.example` gets placeholder lines. `scripts/setup.mjs` replaces them with `randomBytes(32).toString('base64')` (two independent values) when generating `apps/api/.env`, the same way it already generates the better-auth secret.
- `apps/api/.env.test` (new, for the integration suite) holds fixed test-only keys.

### D7 — Web data access (`apps/web`)

- Add `provideHttpClient(withFetch())` to `app.config.ts`. This is the first `apps/api` consumer. `HttpClient` gives `HttpErrorResponse.status` for the 409 mapping and `provideHttpClientTesting` for specs, with no new dependency.
- `features/customers/customers.api.ts`: an injectable `CustomersApi` with `list(query)`, `create`, `update`, `remove`. It wraps `firstValueFrom(http…)` and **parses every response** through the shared response schemas (the D6 network-boundary rule of the Angular migration). It uses `appConfig.apiUrl` (`/api`) + `/v1/customers`. It has two consumers (page and form dialog), which justifies the class.
- Query keys: `['customers', 'list', query]`. Mutations invalidate `['customers']`.

### D8 — Web UI (`apps/web/src/app/features/customers/`)

```
customers/
  customers.ts / .html / .scss / .spec.ts      page: table, search (debounced), paginator
  customer-form-dialog/                        one dialog for create + edit (data: Customer | null)
  customers.api.ts / .spec.ts
```

- Route: `{ path: 'customers', loadComponent: … }` as a child of the shell. The parent `authGuard` gates it, and there is no `adminGuard` because reading is allowed for all authenticated users.
- Nav: an entry in the `Main` group, `{ label: 'Customers', path: '/customers', icon: 'contacts', adminOnly: false }`.
- Write controls render only when `session.user()?.role === RoleEnum.ADMIN`. The server still enforces this; hiding is UX only.
- The form uses `zodValidator(createCustomerSchema / updateCustomerSchema)`. A 409 sets `taxId.setErrors({ conflict: 'NIF already in use' })` and keeps the dialog open. Other errors go to `MatSnackBar` and the dialog stays open.
- Delete confirmation reuses `features/users/confirm-dialog`. This couples to the users feature, not the other way round, so deleting the slice never touches users.

### D9 — Tests (SDD order: spec → tests → code)

| Level | Where | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| unit | `packages/shared-types` | `normalizeNif`, `isValidNif`, schema accept/reject (incl. `sortBy` allow-list, `take` max) |
| unit | `packages/shared` | `SanitizeUtil` redacts `taxId` (nested in `items[]`) |
| unit | `apps/api` | service (mocked `DatabaseService`/`EncryptionService`): encrypt/clear/keep, P2002→409, 404 on deleted, search OR-building. Controller `@Roles` metadata on writes only |
| integration | `apps/api/test/customers.integration.ts` (testcontainers, new `jest-integration.json` + `jest.setup.ts` mirroring `apps/auth`, but with CommonJS test files plus the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag, because the ESM mode hits a `require(esm)` cycle when importing app source; see CORNER_CASES) | real Postgres + real `EncryptionService`, HTTP via supertest, `MicroserviceAuthGuard` overridden by a fake that sets `request.user` with a role. Covers 401/403, 409 incl. concurrent creates, reuse after delete, NIF search, no plaintext in the row |
| unit | `apps/web` (`ng test`) | page shows/hides write controls by role; dialog field errors, 409 → `taxId` conflict; `CustomersApi` parses and rejects malformed responses |
| helpers | `packages/testing-utils` | `createCustomer()` factory (takes an optional `EncryptionService`-compatible encrypt/hash pair). `truncateDatabase` deletes `customer` |

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [`partialIndexes` is a preview feature] → One index, covered by the integration test (409 + reuse after delete). Fallback to raw migration SQL documented in D1.
- [`ILIKE '%term%'` scans the table] → Acceptable at backoffice scale. Upgrade path: `pg_trgm` GIN index on `name`/`email` when listing becomes slow.
- [Key loss or change makes NIFs unreadable and unsearchable] → Fail-fast at boot. Usage note states keys must be backed up and that rotation is not supported.
- [`taxId` redaction is name-based] → A field named differently would not be redacted. The usage note says to append new PII keys to `SENSITIVE_KEYS` and pino `redact.paths`.
- [Full NIF returned to every authenticated reader] → It matches the decided authorization (read = authenticated). Masking for non-admins is a possible later change and is not specified here.
- [Reusing `features/users/confirm-dialog`] → A one-directional coupling. If users is ever removed, move the dialog to a shared folder.

## Migration Plan

1. Set `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_HMAC_KEY` in each `apps/api` environment **before** deploying (boot fails without them).
2. Deploy: `prisma migrate deploy` applies `add_customer`, an additive change (new table plus indexes), so no existing data is touched.
3. Rollback: redeploy the previous release. The extra table is harmless. To remove it fully, add a new migration that drops `customer` rather than editing the applied one.

**Removing the slice from a new project** (the README section the tasks add): delete `apps/api/src/customers/`, `apps/web/src/app/features/customers/`, `customer.schema.ts` and its export, the route and nav entry, the `Customer` model, the `CustomersModule` import, the factory and the truncate line. Then create a new migration dropping the table (or, on a fresh project with no applied migrations, delete the `add_customer` migration folder). Keep the encryption keys and the redaction keys if any PII remains.
