Trace a request through this NestJS + Next.js monorepo. Follow the code from entry to persistence and back.

**Input**: What to trace. Examples:
- An HTTP route: `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email`
- An event: `user:created`
- A tRPC procedure: `users.getUser`
- A job: `job:send_welcome_email`
- A description: "user registration flow"

## Trace Steps

1. **Find the entry point** — grep for controller/handler/processor
2. **Trace the middleware chain** — Guards → Interceptors → Pipes → Controller → Service → DB
3. **Follow service calls** — constructor injections, DB queries
4. **Map side effects** — Redis events emitted, Bull jobs queued, MongoDB writes
5. **Trace the response** — return shape, status code, serializer applied

## Output Format

```
REQUEST: <method> <path>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: Guard — <file>:<line>
Step 2: Pipe — <file>:<line>
Step 3: Controller — <file>:<line>
Step 4: Service — <file>:<line>
Step 5: Database — <model>
Step 6: Side effect — <event/job>
Step 7: Response — <shape> → <status>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL PATH: N hops, M services, K DB queries
```
